Task 1
	before:
          Average response time = 6997 (ms)
          average throughput = 88.4/sec
          
	after:
          Average response time = 97 (ms)
          average throughput = 1.7/sec
	
	change:
          I just loaded average once and then used the variable
          instead of calling the function in each iteration.


Task 2:
  a)
	In my case, the system does not have a reserve.
	Avg througput = 2.0/sec 
	2 * 3600 = 7200 cards/hour
  b)
	NUMBER_OF_PRINTERS = 40  -> throughput = 5.6/sec
